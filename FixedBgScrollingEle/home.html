We are a design studio sprouted from the award winning menswear store Blackbird, first opened in 2004 in Seattle, WA. Blackbird gained international fame for introducing progressive, lesser-known brands that bridged the categories of fashion and lifestyle. Seeing success in retail, Blackbird created an in-house label starting with high quality American-made denim, and expanded over time to include a full apparel assortment, accessories, home goods, and apothecary products. 

The guiding spirit behind Blackbird is Nicole Miller, its founder and creative director, who has endowed it with a manifest soul, making Blackbird a brand that is loved followed across the world. Aided by a small-team of designers, manufacturers, and specialists, Nicole brought Blackbird to new heights in 2013 when she decided to focus on distributing the Blackbird brand internationally and shuttered her stores. 

Today Blackbird is known worldwide for its unconventional and remarkable fragrances and grooming products, although it still produces a small collection of apparel accessories. Blackbird continues to experiment with new and unusual materials, carefully breaking the rules to create unique covetable products for home and personal use.
